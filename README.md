A Student Management System (SMS) using JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlets is a web-based application designed to manage the records and information of students. The system typically allows administrators and teachers to perform various operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing student details. It leverages JSP for dynamic web page generation and Servlets for handling the business logic and HTTP requests.

Key Features:
Student Registration: Allows the registration of students by entering their details such as name, roll number, date of birth, address, contact information, etc.
Student Details Management: Enables updating and deleting student information as required.
Search and Display: Provides functionalities for searching students based on specific criteria (e.g., name, roll number) and displaying their information.
Login and Authentication: Secure login for administrators and teachers to access the system and perform authorized actions.
Course Management: Admins can assign courses to students and keep track of course enrollment and progress.
Technical Implementation:
JSP: Used to display dynamic content and generate HTML pages. JSP files contain HTML tags, along with embedded Java code, to present data and interact with users. It allows separation of presentation and business logic.

Servlet: Acts as a controller, processing client requests, invoking the necessary business logic, and interacting with the database to store or retrieve data. Servlets handle HTTP requests like GET and POST.

Flow of the Application:
User Interaction: The user accesses JSP pages for the front-end (e.g., forms for adding students, viewing student lists, etc.).
Request Handling by Servlet: The form data is sent as an HTTP request to the Servlet, which handles the business logic (e.g., validating input, saving data to the database).
Database Interaction: The Servlet communicates with the database (typically using JDBC) to perform operations such as storing student records, retrieving details, or deleting records.
Response and JSP Rendering: After the Servlet processes the data, it forwards the result to the appropriate JSP page for rendering the updated view or displaying any confirmation messages.
Example Workflow:
Student Registration:

User submits a registration form (JSP page).
Data is sent to a Servlet.
The Servlet validates and processes the data (e.g., check for duplicate roll numbers).
The Servlet interacts with the database to store student information.
A confirmation message or error is displayed back via another JSP page.
Viewing Students:

User requests to view student details (JSP page).
A Servlet retrieves the student information from the database.
The list of students is passed to the JSP for display.
Technologies Used:
JSP (JavaServer Pages) for front-end rendering.
Servlets for handling business logic and requests.
JDBC for database connectivity and management.
MySQL or Oracle for database management (or any relational database).
HTML/CSS for front-end design and user interface.
This architecture provides a simple yet efficient way to manage student records while following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. The Servlets act as the Controller, JSP as the View, and the database represents the Model.
